/// <para>
/// Suppression is a query policy, never a claim property. No claim carries <c>is_mask</c> or any
/// equivalent flag, because whether a claim suppresses is not a fact about the claim — it is the
/// caller's question. One code-block claim suppresses heading recognition under one query and is
/// the primary target of a language collector under the next, and both readings must remain
/// available from the same batch. The engine therefore executes whichever suppression the caller
/// names, through the predicate, and never selects one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// These are compositions over primitives that already exist: <see cref="ClaimSelection.Coverage"/>
/// to derive the suppressed region and <see cref="SpanSet"/> algebra to take its complement.
/// Nothing here is new mechanism, and callers may compose further in the same algebra — several
/// suppressors union their excluded regions, and narrowing to an existing region is an intersection
/// with it. A precomputed "suppression bitmap", as sketched in the legwork, would be an
/// acceleration of exactly this query: same results, different representation, still never a
/// property stored on a claim.
